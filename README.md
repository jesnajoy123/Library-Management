📚 Library Management System – Classic Console Edition

Are you tired of C programs that just sum numbers or reverse strings?
Let’s take it back—old school style—with a real-world project that mimics an actual system.

Library Management System is a beginner-friendly terminal-based C program that lets users manage books like a mini digital librarian—straight from your command line.

No GUI. No internet. Just pure C code and crisp control flow.


✨Features That Make It Shine

Here’s what makes this classic system stand out from the pile of academic assignments:

1. Add New Book:

Capture all essential book info:

Title

Author

Price (MRP)

Books are auto-assigned a unique ID. No duplicates. No fuss.

2. Display All Books:

View every book in the system in a neatly formatted table:

ID

Title

Author

MRP

Status (Available/Issued)


Even your college librarian would approve.

3. Buy a Book (Issue):

Purchase a book by ID and let the system:

Calculate 5% GST

Show the total price

Mark the book as Issued


Classic billing. No receipts, though.

4. Menu-Driven UI:

A clean interface that guides you:

Add

View

Buy

Exit


Just follow the numbers.

5. Input Validation:

Typed something wild? We’ve got basic error handling to keep your library safe.
